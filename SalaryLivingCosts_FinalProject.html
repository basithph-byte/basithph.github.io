        This page's purpose is to show the growing disparity between median household income and living costs in the United States. Data is pulled from each state to show how location can affect those two factors.
        As many of us are about to complete our final year of college in a week, graduate, and transition into our full-time careers, some of us have chosen to stay in state or move out of state for many reasons. It could be for family, growth, opportunities, experiences, fulfillment, or even monetary reasons.
        What's often overlooked is that a higher salary in another state may not necessarily translate to better living conditions, due to the potential for increased living costs and other expenses. To help you understand this, I've prepared a range of visualizations, including maps, line graphs, bar charts, and heat maps. These practical tools will illustrate the disparity between median household income and living costs in the United States, equipping you with the knowledge you need.
        Each visualization on this page is user-friendly and interactive. You can easily hover over the data points to see the exact values and adjust the size of the graph by zooming in and out. Feel free to explore the visualizations in any order, but I recommend starting from the beginning to fully grasp the topic. 
        I will also bring awareness to the lack of financial independence and freedom in the United States and the steps you can take to gain financial independence and freedom.

    <h2>Median Household Income Per State 2023</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a map visualization showing the median household income per state. This data is from 2023, and it is not just recent, but also highly relevant to current events and trends, showing the importance we place on keeping you informed. Each state is color coded, and there is a legend on the right side to show how the intensity of color determines the highest and lowest median salary.

        For South Carolina, the median household income is $69,100. When we consider the Southeast side of the United States, from Mississippi to Virginia, we see a significant income disparity, ranging from $55,060 to $96,490. Moving further up to the Northeast, from Maryland to Maine, the range expands to $75,740 to $106,500, showcasing a substantial increase in household income. As we venture west, the income range fluctuates from a low of $60,980 to a high of $101,200, further highlighting the economic diversity across the country.
        On the surface, states with the highest household incomes appear to be the most appealing. However, it's crucial to consider the impact of living costs and expenses, which often go unnoticed. These factors are the missing piece of the puzzle that can significantly alter the perceived attractiveness of a high-income state.

    <h2>Median House Price Per State 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Here is another map visualization that shows the median house price per state. This data is from 2025 which means that it is the latest and most recent data available. Each state is color coded and there is a legend on the right side to show how the intensity of color determines the highest and lowest median house price.
        Now houses are different from apartments especially when you take into account different living accommodatations however, mortgage and rental rates are about the same and they correlate with living costs and expenses per state which I'll get to in a bit.

        In South Carolina, the median house price is $374,200. If you look at the Southeast side of the United States, from Mississippi to Virginia, it ranges from $251,300 to $440,200. Quite a lot of money for a house; however, the range between these states is not too far off. Going further up to the Northeast from Maryland to Maine, the range is now $373,300 to $819,900. That's a much larger gap in house prices, which is a much bigger range than in the Southeast. But when you start heading west, the housing market becomes even more diverse. It can go as low as $230,600 to as high as $785,900, spanning over 10 states, showcasing the extensive range of house prices in the West.
        Here's the interesting part: the median household income in New York is $81,600, which isn't the most in the Northeast; however, it has the most expensive house price at $819,900. Similarly, California, at $89,870, does not have the highest household income in the West; however, it has the most expensive house price at $785,900. Yes, the median household income is from 2023, which compares to house prices in 2025; however, considering inflation and market trends over the past couple of years, the differences are negligible. 
        And speaking of inflation, here is a line graph showing the inflation rate for both median household income and home price from 1984 to 2023.
    </p>

    <h2>Median Household Income vs Home Price 1984-2023</h2>
    <p>
        A line graph shows median household income and house prices from 1984 to 2023. This is to put into perspective the comparison of how inflation affected both factors over the past 40 years. Now, both household income and home prices are different for each state. However, the disparity between household income and home price is about the same for most, if not all, states.

        Starting in 1984, the median household income was $58,930, while the median home price was $79,950. So far, it seems reasonable that there is about a 1.36% difference between household income and home price. The average worker could put a downpayment on a mortgage and pay off the house in about 5-10 years. They could save up for a few years and fully buy the house. However, over the next 10 years, home prices rise exponentially while household income keeps a steady baseline at a flat rate.
        In 2003, the home price was $192,125, while household income was $68,350. Home prices increased by 2.4%, while household income only increased by 1.16%. The gap between income and home price in 2003 has grown to 2.8%. However, the real shock came when the housing market peaked at $432,950 in 2022, a staggering figure that far outstripped the modest rise in household income to $77,540. Since 2003, home prices have increased drastically by 2.25%, whereas income only increased by 1.13%. The gap between income and home price in 2022 is at a staggering 5.58%. 
        Now, house ownership differs from renting apartments, whether you pay off the house in 20 to 30 years or live in an apartment for less than a few years. However, mortgages and rental prices are about the same, showing how much living costs have increased over the past 40 years. Even leasing houses are about the same as renting an apartment. This stark comparison underscores the significant financial strain that increasing living costs have placed on households, with costs rising exponentially while household income only grew linearly.
        The drastic increase in living costs can be attributed to various factors, including demand and interest rates. However, the substantial gap between income and home prices is a key contributor. This growing gap is not just a statistic, it's a trend that is eroding financial independence and freedom. It's also a factor in the declining buying and negotiating power of individuals. These issues will be explored in more detail shortly, but first, let's examine a heatmap that illustrates living costs indexes per state.
    </p>

    <h2>Cost of Living Index Per State 2024</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a heatmap that shows the cost of living index per state. This data is from 2024; however, it is still recent and relevant to current events and trends. Each state is color-coded, with a legend on the right side that shows how the intensity of color determines the highest and lowest level of living index. Num_2024 is the Cost of Living Index per State, and then the rest is broken up into different categories such as groceries, health, housing, transportation, etc.

        vizElement.style.width = '100%';
        vizElement.style.height = (divElement.offsetWidth * 0.75) + 'px';

    <p>
        The cost of living index measures how much it costs to live in a particular state. The index considers the residing costs for that state and breaks it down into different categories. For example, the cost of living index for the most affordable states is around 90 and even 85. However, for more expensive states, they range around 100 to 130, peaking at 186.9 for Hawaii. Housing is the same for affordable states; the range is from 70 to around 100, while the more expensive states range from 115 to around 220, again peaking at 310 for Hawaii.
        Groceries are the most consistent for 50 states, at around 100, while Hawaii peaked at 130.4. Transportation and Miscellaneous are also the most consistent for 50 states, as are Utilities; however, Hawaii again peaks at 198. I am starting to see a trend here.
        While New York and California are often cited as the most expensive states to live in, Hawaii also holds this distinction. It's intriguing to note that Hawaii, despite having a higher cost of living index than California and New York, actually has lower median house prices. This suggests that the high cost of living in Hawaii is not solely due to housing costs, but also factors in other living expenses such as groceries, transportation, and utilities. 
    </p>

    <h2>State Income Tax Rate 2025</h2>
    <p>
        This is a side-by-side bar chart showing the state income tax rate. This data is from 2025, making it the most recent and relevant data available. The side-by-side bar chart shows the low and high-income tax rates per state, and I will explain how it correlates to living costs.
    </p>
    <iframe src="state_income_tax_comparison_2025.html"></iframe>
    <p>
        The side-by-side bar chart shows both low and high-income tax rates to show if the income tax is influenced by household income. Like in California, the lowest income tax rate is 1%; however, the highest income tax rate goes up to 13.3%! Similarly, for Hawaii, the lowest income tax rate is at 1.4%; however, the highest is at 11%. New York's highest income tax rate also matches Hawaii's at 10.9%; however, their lowest income tax rate is higher at 4%.
        South Carolina, however, has a flat income tax rate of 6.2%, making it the only state in this dataset with only one fixed income tax rate. A flat income tax rate means that regardless of your income, you will pay the same percentage in taxes. States like Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not have state income taxes. However, Washington's condition is a 7% long-term capital gains tax on profits above the state's standard deduction.
        Why does state income tax matter? Because it is a deduction from your salary and adds to your living costs depending on the state. It is another factor to take into account when it comes to calculating your monthly expenses, and being informed about it is crucial for financial preparedness.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Financial Literacy Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Looking at the visualizations above, which compare household income to house values as well as the cost of living index and state income tax, it is clear why financial literacy matters. Financial literacy is the understanding of your financial state, which consists of budgeting, spending, saving, investing, and even borrowing. It is about having the knowledge and skills to make responsible and informed financial decisions that affect your financial security and well-being [1].
        We've seen that comparing median household income to the median house price, the cost of living index, and state income tax are crucial aspects of financial literacy. However, another significant factor that can't be overlooked is debt. Student loan debt, in particular, is a substantial obstacle to achieving financial independence and freedom. It's the second-highest consumer debt category after mortgages. Shockingly, 20% of all American adults with undergraduate degrees are burdened with outstanding student debt, which rises to 24% for postgraduate degree holders. Even more concerning, only 20% of adults in the US have managed to pay off their student loans [2]. 
        It's staggering to see how many college students take up loans and how many have outstanding debt balances. Now, this is not about whether you should go to college or not; however, taking up a loan that accumulates in debt with interest will also affect your monthly expenses that go into your cost of living. That is why nearly half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck [3]. Furthermore, it shows why many Americans are not financially independent and free. Many work daily to make a living while paying off a considerable debt.
        Financial literacy and health are often overlooked and misunderstood, especially by many young adults just starting their careers and lives. However, it's crucial to understand that this is not a burden that has to be accepted. With the proper knowledge and skills, making educated decisions can lead to financial independence and freedom. So, while the road ahead may seem daunting, there is always hope.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Become More Financially Independent and Free</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, we make choices unknowingly, and we can't go back to the past. However, what we do now can help our future. Here are some ways to become more financially independent and free. The first thing you should do is assess your entire situation. How much do you make per month? How much do you take home? Are you able to cover expenses? If not, what is blocking you from covering expenses? How much are you spending? Is it a necessity? If not, then can it be taken out [4]?
        The cost of living can be very high depending on where we live. However, some consumables we don't consider are our cable, subscriptions, and food purchases. These things add to our expenses without our knowledge, and sometimes, those prices are raised without our knowledge. Writing all of this down and considering everything can help you have a clear picture of where you are now and what you need to do so that you can direct yourself to the root cause and drastically cut your expenses.
        Doing so leaves you with only the essential expenses and some savings in the bank. Start by paying off your debt as soon as possible. Begin with the highest debt, usually the highest interest rate. It could be your student loans, mortgage, car payments, or credit cards. The sooner you pay them off, the sooner you'll feel the burden lift. As you reduce your expenses, allocate more towards your debt, relieving yourself of that financial weight.
        Then, you can start budgeting and setting realistic financial goals. It could be to buy a car or a house or even to pay off debt. Consider the cost and the time it will take. To make it more manageable, set achievable milestones along the way. As you reach these milestones, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment, knowing you're closer to your goal. Budgeting also gives you a clear understanding of your income, expenses, and what you can and cannot afford. 
        Also, it's good to avoid unnecessary expenses and debt. Like ask yourself, do you need that car? Do you need that house or apartment? Is it worth the price, the payment, the interest rate? Can you find a better deal? Will it make you feel better? Is it worth moving to that state or location? How do people feel about living there with the rising cost of living? Yes, you may not get everything you want because you can't afford it; however, it helps you value and respect yourself, giving you appreciation and gratitude for what you have. It helps provide you with peace of mind even if you have little.
        Unfortunately, your mindset also matters as some of us still have the scarcity mindset from our youth, families, and even in school. We look at money as a means of living and are always strapped for cash. However, what if money is a tool that can help you solve your problems and make life for you and others better? By adopting the abundance mindset, which is the belief that there is always enough and more to go around, you can find more ideas and options to help you become financially independent and free. One thing that can help you build wealth is investing.
        I am not a financial expert, so please consult a certified professional. However, many people with economic independence and freedom who invest have the most success in stocks, bonds, real estate, and mutual funds. Now, this is not quick money. However, it can turn into passive income, which is money earned with little to no effort that accumulates over time as you invest wisely in increments that can help you build wealth. Another thing you can do to make more money alongside your job is to have a side hustle or freelance.
        There are more entrepreneurs now than ever, many of them being millionaires, and they have started with side hustles and freelancing. They either created a product, sold a service, or even made a business that helped them increase their income streams. Adding another income stream and increasing them can help you build financial stability and growth. Think of a skill and passion you can monetize. Share your story online and create content. Build a following that you can build into a market. This will be a lot of trial and error and will take some time; however, it can help lead to many new opportunities.
        Most importantly, you should continually educate yourself no matter what. Times are constantly changing, and you can never predict the market; however, if you keep learning, you can always stay ahead and adjust your strategy to adapt to the situation. Even though some of us are graduating and about to transition into our full-time careers, education never stops. There's always something new you can learn every day.
